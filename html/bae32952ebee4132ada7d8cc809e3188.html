<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">If you plan on offering Statements of Accomplishment for your course, you'll need to work with the Course Operations team to get a few things in order.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">You need to consider:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">
<ul>
<li>Whether you want on-demand SoA generation (usually for a self-paced course) or one-time SoA generation (usually at the end of a scheduled course)</li>
<li>What levels of SoA you want to offer and what grades they correspond to (e.g. 70% for a basic SoA, 90% for one "with distinction")</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">We will need:</p>
<ul style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">
<ul>
<li>Your thoughts on&nbsp;the above points</li>
<li>Names and titles of each instructor to be listed on the SoA</li>
<li>High quality image file of each instructor's signature</li>
<li>Optional: brief description of the work required to earn each level of SoA (up to ~6 lines or ~400 characters per level)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">See below for an example of a Statement of Accomplishment with descriptive text.&nbsp;It will take our team a few days to set up the Statement generation system for your course, so please start thinking about all this now.</p>
