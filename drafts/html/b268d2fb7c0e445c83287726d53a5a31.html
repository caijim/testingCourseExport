<p><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">To make a Unit graded, first you need to decide what assignment types you want to have in your course.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">You define your grading policy (including assignment types, weights, and numbers) on the Grading page in Studio.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">For example, you might decide to have 10 Homeworks (20% final grade, 1 droppable), 10 Reading Quizzes (20%), 1 Midterm (30%), and 1 Final (30%).&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px; font-size: 1em;">To get to this page, scroll to the top of&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px; font-size: 1em;">any Studio</span><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px; font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;page and click the Settings menu, then Grading.</span></p>
<p>Once you've defined your assignment types, you need to mark your subsections as belonging to a certain assignment type. You do this from the Course Outline page.&nbsp;Click the gear icon next to the subsection title:</p>
<p><span><img src="/static/markgraded.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" width="879" height="279" /></span></p>
<p><span>Then pick an assignment type in the popup (and assign a due date, if you like)&nbsp;and click Save. Everything in that subsection will count as one assignment of the chosen assignment type. </span></p>
<p><span>Go ahead and set up your grading policy on the Grading page, then mark a subsection as graded. </span></p>
<p>If you plan on offering a Statement of Accomplishment with your course, please go to Part 3.5: Statements of Accomplishment. Or, if you won't be offering an SoA, go ahead to Part 4: Files &amp; Uploads.</p>
