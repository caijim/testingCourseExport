<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">If you want to add a file to your course, you can do so from the Files &amp; Uploads page, available through the Content menu at the top of any Studio page. After you upload a file, you can add it to a course page with the "Embed URL" given on the Files &amp; Uploads page. This is safer than pointing to a file hosted outside a course &ndash; sometimes external websites change their file or URL structures, and this will break any links pointing to old locations.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">Go to the Files &amp; Uploads page and copy the Embed URL of one of the images already there. Then come back to this page and edit this&nbsp;component. Click the little picture icon and paste in the Embed URL to add the image. Remember to Save and Publish your changes.</p>
