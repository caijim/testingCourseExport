<h2>Manually Grade in-class or Offline Assignments</h2>
<p>A fourth way in which you can use LTI components is to grade items that are not available in the course.</p>
<p>This can be very useful to online courses that either contain an in-person element or an assignment that cannot be submitted via the in-course&nbsp;materials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable this functionality, contact the CourseOps team.&nbsp; We will then set up the appropriate configurations in your course.&nbsp; This will involve creating a new unit in a subsection of your choosing, and creating an LTI component.&nbsp; Once this LTI component is set up in your course, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark the subsection the unit is in as a graded assignment.<br /><br /><img src="/static/grading_settings_0_v2.png" style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-width: 1px;" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" height="343" width="623" /></li>
<li>Update the number of assignments in your Grading page.<br /><br /><img src="/static/grading_settings_1_v2-1.png" style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-width: 1px;" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" height="185" width="623" /><br /><br />You'll be left with a tool that can take a grade you (or CourseOps on your behalf) specify and display it in a participant's Progress page as well as the course grade report.</li>
<li>Let us know when you've done this, and we will then create a new .csv file and send it to you.</li>
<li>Once you have received and scored submissions for this in-class or otherwise offline assignment, refer to this file and input your participants' earned scores in the third column, followed by the maximum score possible, and any comments you want to add.&nbsp; Note that the score earned cannot be higher than the maximum score possible.<br /><br /><img style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-width: 1px;" src="/static/sample_filled_out_csv.png" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" height="447" width="791" /></li>
<li>Save your changes and send this revised file back to us.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result will be that your participants will see a new graded item in their Progress pages:</p>
<p><img src="/static/grading_settings_2_v2.png" style="border: 1px solid #000000; border-width: 1px;" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" height="326" width="639" /></p>
<p>They will also see the grade they earned and any feedback provided in the Courseware unit:</p>
