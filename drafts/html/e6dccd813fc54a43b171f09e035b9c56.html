<p>You can also create questions that use a pool of answers to draw from. So you can set up multiple choice question with "N" nubmer of answer options and select to display "Y" of those options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the question below has 6 answers but only displays 4 of them. You can also have multiple&nbsp;"correct" answers and provide explanations based on the different correct answers similar to the targeted feedback questions.</p>
<p>Additional documentation for setting up answer pools is available <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/multiple_choice.html#use-the-advanced-editor-to-configure-answer-pools" target="[object Object]">here</a>.</p>
