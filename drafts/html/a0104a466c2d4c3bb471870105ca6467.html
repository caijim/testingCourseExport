<p>The timed exams feature allows an instructor to set a time limit for each problem in an assignment. A student cannot see a timed&nbsp;problem until they click the "Start Timer" button, at which point they are given&nbsp;a certain amount of time to click the Submit button or receive no points for that question. A countdown timer lets them know how much time remains. Once the timer reaches zero, the student is&nbsp;no longer allowed to submit their answer. The timer continues counting down even if they leave the page or lose their internet connection.</p>
<p>To turn a problem into a timed problem, go to the Edit page of the component and put a non-zero value in the "Minutes Allowed" field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an example of timed problems, see the next unit.</p>
