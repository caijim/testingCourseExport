<h2>WELCOME TO STUDIO</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">Welcome to Studio, the Open edX course authoring interface. This is where you will build your course. If you're already familiar with Studio, feel free to delete this section and go straight to the Course Checklist in the Tools menu. Otherwise, you may find this brief introduction useful.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;"><em><span style="color: #808080;">(Note:&nbsp;this is intended to be read in Studio, not the live course. If you are in your live course and don't see studio.class.stanford.edu in your browser bar, you can get to this page in Studio&nbsp;by clicking the "View Unit in Studio" button. If a popup asks for you for authentication,&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">sign in with username stanford and password&nbsp;pressbuilding.)</span></span></em></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">We'll start with&nbsp;where you are right now. This is a Unit, which corresponds to a single page of content in your course. A Unit can contain&nbsp;various components &ndash; things like videos, problem sets, or simple text like this. You can add a component using the green buttons below. Go ahead and click on the HTML button, then choose the Text option.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">Once you have your new HTML component, you'll want to add some content to it. Click the Edit button on the top right of your new component. You'll see a basic text editor open up. The formatting options here are all pretty standard &ndash; add some text to your component and play around with the different buttons to see what they do.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">When you're done, click the blue Save button on the bottom left. You can preview the new draft with the blue Preview Changes button on the top right (note that you'll have to sign in with username stanford and password&nbsp;pressbuilding), and compare it with the current version by clicking the View Live Version button. When you're satisfied that your changes are as&nbsp;you want them,&nbsp;click the big blue Publish button on the right side of the page to make this draft of the&nbsp;Unit replace the old one. Don't worry, students won't see anything &ndash; this whole section is for staff eyes only.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">To move on, scroll down and click the "Part&nbsp;2: Video" link on the bottom right of the page.</p>
