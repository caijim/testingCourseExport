<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">Many courses include video components as a replacement for or supplement to traditional lectures. It's easy to add a video to your course &ndash; just follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">
<li>Work with the video production team to record your videos and upload them to your course YouTube account.</li>
<li>Create a video component using the green buttons below.</li>
<li>Find and copy the YouTube ID of the video you want to put in the unit. The YouTube ID is an 11-character string of random numbers and letters, like&nbsp;OEoXaMPEzfM. It will be part of the URL of the video.</li>
<li>In your video component, click the Edit button on the top right. Then paste your&nbsp;YouTube ID over the default one. Be sure not to delete the http://youtu.be part of the URL.</li>
<li>Click Save, then Publish.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">And that's it! But there's plenty more you can do with videos, too. If you work with the video production team to get your videos transcribed, you can include captions like the ones in the video below. We can also add download links to the video player, if you want users to be able to download the videos and watch them offline.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">For now, try replacing the video below with a different one from YouTube. When you're ready to move on, scroll down and click the "Part 3: Problems and Grading" link on the bottom right.</p>
