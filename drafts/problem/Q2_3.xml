      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Astronomers - by accident - recently discovered a ring system (consisting of 2 rings, one thinner, one thicker) around the rock named Chariklo.  This discovery was made when scientists were observing an occultation (when a star obstructs our view of a planet temporarily) of Jupiter by Chariklo in March 2014.  They noticed that the planet appeared to dim shortly before and after the occultation by Chariklo, indicating something else was passing between our view of the planet.   </p>
