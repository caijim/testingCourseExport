Revise the following paragraph for clarity and brevity:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;p&gt;Prior to calculating suicide rates that are stratified by church membership and activity level, records from the state and from the church needed to be linked. However, state death records and church records do not share a common unique identifier. In order to link records from these two sources, we used the probabilistic linking program LinkedPro7 (17). This program calculates probabilities to determine whether a pair of records refers to the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;    &lt;/body&gt;&#10;    &lt;explanation&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;To calculate suicide rates according to church membership and activity, we had to link state death records with church membership records. These sources do not share a common identifier; so, we linked them using LinkedPro7 software (17), which calculates the probability that a pair of records match.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;    &lt;/explanation&gt;&#10;    &lt;demandhint&gt;&#10;        &lt;hint&gt;Try combining sentences together and eliminating unnecessary words.&lt;/hint&gt;&#10;        &lt;hint&gt;Pretend you're speaking to someone you know. Write the above passage in a more natural speaking style. This might help to cut out elaborate phrasing.&lt;/hint&gt;&#10;    &lt;/demandhint&gt;&#10;&lt;/submit_and_compare&gt;&#10;&#10;" your_answer_label="Your Response:"/>
